Hi there, good to see you here. I am glad you stopped by. I am Jaswinder. An engineering graduate from Army Institute of technology,Pune.
College was fun, mostly contructive and transformational. 

I am an ordinary software developer 8 hours a day but other than that I like to spend my time reading books, composing music and most of all doing mathematics and understanding techniques to interpret data better. 
The most important application of data driven decisions according to me is to find out and understand how the mother Earth is changing because of human actions and how can we stop the catastrophic effects that will follow.

I am also involved with some reserchers at MILA, Montreal, Canada working towards climate change action, you can reach out to me if you wish to contribute and want to be added in our slack group.
